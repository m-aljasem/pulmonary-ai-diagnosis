# Chest X-ray Multi-condition Classification

## Abstract

This project implements a deep learning solution for chest x-ray multi-condition classification. 
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets using 
modern transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.

## Key Contributions

1. Implementation of robust data preprocessing pipeline
2. Application of transfer learning for medical imaging
3. Comprehensive evaluation with multiple metrics: Per-condition AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall
4. Production-ready deployment with Streamlit interface

## Methodology

### Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Task: Multi-label Classification
- Preprocessing: Normalization, augmentation, train/val/test split

### Model Architecture
- Base: Pre-trained CNN (transfer learning)
- Custom head: Task-specific layers
- Training: Two-phase (frozen base + fine-tuning)

### Evaluation Metrics
Per-condition AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall
